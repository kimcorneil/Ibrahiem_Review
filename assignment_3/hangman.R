## Two hashtags is me (reviewer)

## Reviewer comments: 
##' overall worked great. I liked the option to enter a word or a letter. 
##' Good job explaining where to look and what you did at the beginning with NOTES
##' Your use of creating functions for various steps in communicating with the user and checking their input made your MAIN CODE very easy to follow and simlified it
##' The code ran as expected when I tried to type in random things (instead of the desired input)
##' All steps were clearly explained (in creating the functions and in the main code)
##' Great job!!

###########
## NOTES ##
###########

#'it is recommended to start with reading the main section of the code before the functions
#'the text file containing the words is all lowercase, so user input throughout the code will be forced to match
#'this program assumes the "words.txt" file is in your working directory
#'the cat() function was used in place of the print() function for visual consistency
